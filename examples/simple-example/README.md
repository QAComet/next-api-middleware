# About

This is an example project using Next.js's app router and the `@qacomet/next-api-middleware` library giving a simple demonstration of the middleware together with basic API routes. There are two examples given, one using a class-based handler and another using a file-based handler.

The main relevant files are

```sh
app/middleware/index.ts
app/dashboard/route.ts
app/dashboard/[userId]/route.ts
```
